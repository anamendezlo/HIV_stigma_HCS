  <h1>Measuring HIV Knowledge and Attitudes in the Healthcare Setting</h1>
  <p>Welcome to the survey measuring HIV knowledge and attitudes in the healthcare setting in Europe and Central Asia.</p>
  <p>The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European AIDS Clinical Society (EACS) are working to understand HIV knowledge and attitudes in healthcare settings.</p>
  <p>If you work in the healthcare sector in Europe or Central Asia, you are invited to take this survey. You should also be aged more than 18 years old.</p>
  <p>Your responses will help us identify the needs and priorities of both healthcare workers and people living with HIV so that we can reduce HIV-related negative attitudes and behaviours in healthcare settings in Europe and Central Asia.</p>
  <p>The survey is anonymous and confidential, and no information will be collected, stored, or transferred that allows for the identification of participants (as defined within the EU General Data Protection Regulation). IP addresses will also not be recorded. This means you must complete the survey in one session and cannot return later.</p>
  <p>The anonymous data will be hosted by ECDC (the data custodian) and processed in accordance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation. The anonymous data will be shared with ECDC academic and community partners in accordance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation.</p>
  <p>The survey takes approximately 10 minutes to complete.</p>
  <p>You are free to withdraw from the survey anytime. You do not have to answer any questions if you do not want to. If you have any concerns about this study, you can contact Teymur.Noori@ecdc.europa.eu, ecdc.info@ecdc.europa.eu, and info@eacsociety.org.</p>
